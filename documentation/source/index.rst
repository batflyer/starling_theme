Quick-start
-----------

Stable versions are hosted on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/starling-theme/>`_, and may be installed with ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Install with pip
  $ pip install starling-theme

  # Check installed version
  $ python
  >>> import starling_theme
  >>> print(starling_theme.__version__)

The ``html_theme`` in your Sphinx ``conf.py`` can then be set to use this theme. If the theme was generated using ``sphinx_quickstart``, some of the options specific to alabaster may also need to be adjusted.

.. code-block:: diff

    # The name of the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style to use.
  + pygments_style = 'monokai'
  - pygments_style = 'sphinx'

    # -- Options for HTML output ----------------------------------------------

    # The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the  documentation for
    # a list of builtin themes.
    #
  + html_theme = 'starling_theme'
  - html_theme = 'alabaster'

    # This is required for the alabaster theme
    # refs: http://alabaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#sidebars

  - html_sidebars = {
  -       '**': [
  -           'about.html',
  -           'navigation.html',
  -           'relations.html',  # needs 'show_related': True theme option to display
  -           'searchbox.html',
  -           'donate.html',
  -       ]
  - }
