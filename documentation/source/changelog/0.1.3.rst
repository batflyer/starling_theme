0.1.3: Transfer to starling-lab
===============================

TL;DR: ✏️ Transferring repository from ``batflyer/starling_theme`` to ``starling-lab/starling-theme``.

This patch is being applied to finalize the move from ``github.com/batflyer/starling_theme`` to ``github.com/starling-theme``. The rename is done to ensure that names are consistent between the package hosted on PyPi and the name associated with the GitHub repository.

Since the imported package uses underscores (in accordance with Python's syntax requirements), the source folders will still use the ``starling_theme`` convention.

This mainly affects the ``setup.py`` script, with minor tweaks to hyperlinks and directions in the associated documentation (specifically the ``README.rst``, ``documentation/source/developer_guide/01_development_environment.rst``, ``documentation/source/index.rst``).
