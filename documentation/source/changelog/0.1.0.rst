========================
0.1.0: Static Navigation
========================

* Table of Contents:

  * ``layout.html`` and ``theme.css`` adjusted to create a static Table of Contents that follows along the left side of the page as the user scrolls down.
  * This collapses into a drop-down menu in mobile view.

* ``theme.conf``:

  * includehidden = True
  * navigation_depth = 4

* Search:

  * Search bar is currently placed at the top of the screen.
  * Default text replaced with "Search project documentation" to help prevent it being mixed up with site-wide search.

* Documentation:

  * ``conf.py`` imports version information directly from ``starling_theme.__init__``
  * ``index.rst`` set to have hidden table of contents (now that the actual Table of Contents is resolved).
